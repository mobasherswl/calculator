# calculator
This project was created while studying Java language course. It was a long time ago &amp; way before I was fully aware of design patterns, best coding practices or any thing neat, clean &amp; simple for that matter. The main focus at that time was to imitate the Windows calculator features / functionality which was achieved very well.

Its executable JAR can be found at:
